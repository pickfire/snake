Broken Snake
============

I wanted to do a multiplayer snake game in terminal but I guess I made when I
mix both sync and async code together as well as mixing the client and server
part, probably would have been easier if I separate out the server.

I separated it into another thread but not sure why it isn't listening on the
port.
